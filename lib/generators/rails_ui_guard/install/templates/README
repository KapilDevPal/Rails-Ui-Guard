Rails UI Guard has been installed!

Next steps:

1. Run the migration:
   rails db:migrate

2. Include in your model (e.g., School):
   class School < ApplicationRecord
     include RailsUiGuard::FeatureStatusable
     has_feature_status
   end

3. Include in ApplicationController:
   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
     include RailsUiGuard::ControllerHelpers
   end

4. Use in your controllers:
   class FeesController < ApplicationController
     before_action -> { enforce_feature_access("fee_management") }
     
     def index
       @module_status = current_school.module_status("fee_management")
     end
   end

5. Add to your layout (app/views/layouts/application.html.erb):
   <%= render_module_overlay(@module_status) %>
